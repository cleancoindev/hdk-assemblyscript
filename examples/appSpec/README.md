# assemblyscript-example-app

Example of running an app using a Rust based holochain container.

Install [holochain-cmd](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-cmd), and also Rust (with Cargo). Both are expected in your path for `./build-and-test.sh` to run.

In a CLI:

First, change directories to the root directory of hdk-assemblyscript.

In that directory, run `npm install`

Second, change directories into `examples/appSpec`.

In that directory, run `./build-and-test.sh`
